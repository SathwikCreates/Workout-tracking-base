# Workout Tracking Base

A simple and intuitive fitness tracker app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to log their daily push-ups and crunches, track totals, view a history of entries, and use a timer for workouts. The app also saves data to `localStorage` so it persists across page reloads.

## Features

- **Log Push-ups and Crunches**: Track your daily workouts by entering the number of push-ups and crunches you've completed.
- **View History**: See a list of your previous entries, including the date and total reps for push-ups and crunches.
- **Total Reps**: View your cumulative total of push-ups and crunches.
- **Timer**: Use the built-in timer to time your workout sessions. Start, stop, and reset the timer as needed.
- **Clear History**: Reset all workout history stored in `localStorage` with the click of a button.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Used for the basic structure and form elements.
